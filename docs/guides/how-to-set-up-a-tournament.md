# How to set up a tournament

This guide walks you through the **basic flow** of creating a tournament in MatchZy Auto Tournament .
For a full walkthrough with screenshots, see [Your First Tournament](../getting-started/first-tournament.md).

## 1. Check your prerequisites

Before you create a tournament, make sure you have:

- At least **2 teams** created (with enough players).
- At least **one CS2 server** registered on the **Servers** page.
- A **map pool** ready (you can use the default Active Duty pool).

## 2. Create the tournament

1. Go to the **Tournament** page in the sidebar.
2. Click **“Create Tournament”**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** – what you want to call the event.
   - **Description** – optional short text for your own reference.
4. Choose the **tournament type** (for example Single Elimination or Double Elimination).
5. Choose the **match format** (BO1 / BO3 / BO5, or Round Robin/Swiss).

## 3. Select teams and map pool

1. Select the **teams** you want to include.
2. Choose a **map pool**:
   - Use **Active Duty** if you are unsure.
   - Or pick one of your **custom map pools**.

Click **“Generate Bracket”** to create all matches.

## 4. Share team pages and start

1. From the tournament view, copy the **public team URLs**.
2. Send each team their link so they can:
   - See their upcoming matches.
   - Join veto and view server info.
3. When you are ready, start the tournament from the **Bracket** or **Matches** view and monitor progress.

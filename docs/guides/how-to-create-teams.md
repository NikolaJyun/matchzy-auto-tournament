# How to create teams

This guide covers the **basic steps** for creating teams in MatchZy Auto Tournament .
For a more detailed guide (including JSON import and advanced options), see [Managing Teams](managing-teams.md).

## 1. Create a team

1. Go to the **Teams** page in the sidebar.
2. Click **“Create Team”**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Team Name**
   - **Team Tag** (short code, e.g. `NAVI`, `G2`)
   - **Logo URL** (optional)
4. Click **“Create Team”**.

You can always edit a team later to change name, tag, or logo.

## 2. Add players to the team

1. From the **Teams** page, click your team to open its details.
2. Use the **Add Player** action.
3. For each player, enter:
   - Steam ID or vanity URL
   - Player name
   - Optional **ELO rating** (if you leave it blank, the default from **Settings** is used).
4. Save the player.

Repeat until the team has enough players for your tournament format (typically at least 5).

## 3. Share the public team page

Each team has a **public URL** like:

`https://your-domain.com/team/team-name`

Share this link with the team so they can:

- See their upcoming matches.
- Join veto and view server info.
- Follow live scores and match status.

# How to manage matches

This guide gives admins a **simple checklist** for watching and controlling matches in MatchZy Auto Tournament .
For full detail, see [Running Matches](running-matches.md).

## 1. Find your matches

1. Go to the **Matches** page in the sidebar.
2. Use filters (if available) to narrow down by tournament or status.
3. Click a match to open its **details view**.

From here you can see:

- Which teams are playing.
- Current score and status.
- How many players have connected and are ready.

## 2. Monitor progress

- Watch the **status** (warmup, live, halftime, finished).
- Check how many players are connected (for example “8/10 players connected”).
- Use the match details to see exactly which players are missing.

If something looks stuck (for example warmup never ends), you can use admin controls (see below).

## 3. Use admin controls when needed

In the match details view you have controls such as:

- **Pause / Unpause** – stop or resume the match.
- **End Warmup** – start the match if players are ready but it is stuck in warmup.
- **Restart Round / Restart Match** – fix serious issues by replaying from a known point.
- **Add Backup Player** – swap in a substitute if a player cannot connect.

Use these controls **sparingly** and explain your decisions to both teams.

## 4. After the match

Once a match ends:

- The **winner** is assigned automatically.
- The **bracket** updates on its own.
- Demo files are uploaded if your servers and webhook URL are correctly configured.

If a result looks wrong or a demo is missing, see:

- [Match Recovery](match-recovery.md)
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

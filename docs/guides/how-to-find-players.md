# How to find players

This guide shows you simple ways to **look up players** in MatchZy Auto Tournament so you can check profiles, help them join teams, or debug issues.

## Find a player by Steam ID or URL

If you know a player’s Steam information:

1. Go to the **Players** page in the sidebar.
2. Use the search box to enter one of:
   - Steam64 ID
   - Steam32 ID
   - Steam vanity URL (if you have configured a Steam Web API key in **Settings**).
3. Select the player from the results to view their profile and recent matches.

## Find a player from a team

If you know the team but not the exact Steam ID:

1. Go to the **Teams** page in the sidebar.
2. Click the team to open its details.
3. Use the **Players** section to see all players on that team.
4. From here, you can:
   - View a player’s information
   - Add or remove players from the team (see [Managing Teams](managing-teams.md))

## Find a player from a public team page

If teams are using their **public team pages**:

1. Open the team’s public URL (for example `https://your-domain.com/team/team-name`).
2. Scroll to the roster to see all players on that team.
3. Use this list to match players with their Steam accounts in the admin interface if needed.
